## üîÅ Update Protocol

1. Location: save next to the active WORK file under the same date/service folder.
   - Path: `dev_artifacts/agents/YYYY.MM.DD_[service_or_component]/TODO.md`
2. File name: `TODO.md` (one per active WORK). If multiple TODOs are needed, use `TODO_[phase].md`.
3. How to update:
   - Append new rows to the table under "Task Summary" with clear, actionable descriptions.
   - Keep grouped action areas in sync (move resolved items out; promote urgent items).
   - Update Status to `Open`, `In Progress`, or `Done`.
4. Ownership:
   - Add an "Owner" in the Suggested Next Step if a task is assigned.
5. Closure:
   - When all Critical Fixes are `Done`, note readiness for TESTER/UPDATER in WORK.md.
